      <p>i can't believe it's been 1 year since i first gave you flowers. that was the first time i felt happy just making you happy. i remember thinking nung una na idk what i'm doing uli when i gave it cos i was in that phase and told myself i wouldn't wanna be like that with just anyone again. but i knew you weren't just anyone.</p>

      <p>you make me nervous in every good way possible. you've always looked unreal to me. a big reason why i still can't believe you're my gf is cos of your looks. everything about you is the prettiest to me, both your face and your body. you always look so pretty even when you don't try. the way you make me feel when i sneak glances at you is still how you made me feel the first time our eyes met irl. it looked like you had whole universes inside yours. i always wish you could see yourself how i see you whenever you overthink cos you really are the prettiest and that'll never change. you will always be my type and my crush no matter what happens. no one else will ever compare.</p>

      <p>but even more than your looks, what made me fall in love with you is just how you are as a person. we're literally the same person. you're the only person i enjoy spending time with more than myself. you make me laugh and smile til my face aches. your presence makes me so calm and relaxed, and i feel like i can be myself only around you. you make me enjoy the smallest things in life. you give me minecraft gifts and make me feel like the only thing i have to worry about is how i'd kill the ender dragon. i will forever be grateful that i get to spend my life with the only person who can make me feel this way. you love me like no one else can.</p>

      <p>i love and will always love you endlessly. you are with me forever mahal ko. i will always be here every valentine's, every day, every second, for the rest of our lives.</p>

            you are my forever <em>comfort person</em> and <em>best friend</em>. and if you were a song to me, you'd be this one. i feel like i'm listening to this song whenever we're together. you make me feel calm, like a kid, and like nothing else matters in the world but you.

            this song always reminds me of how addicted i was to u to the point where i almost failed my cs class. i'll always be addicted to spending time with you in any way i can. i'll always choose to be with you over anyone, without a second thought.
